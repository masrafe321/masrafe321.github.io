            Taking the Lead
          </span>
          <span>
            We get it. Creating a new website or refining your brand can be
            scary and the process may seem daunting and chaotic That’s where we
            come in, taking the lead and guiding you through the journey. Once a
            client brings forward their initial ideas, we will guide the process
            to create a clear pathway to success. Because let’s face it, that’s
            what specialists are for - right?

            No Bull Sh*t
          </span>

          <span>
            No jargon, no nonsense! We can't stand the overuse of technical
            language and the smoke and mirrors of tech speak. We pride ourselves
            on matching our communication style with that of our partners and
            adapting our comms to suit. We also understand that running a
            business is busy so why beat around the bush, let's all be honest
            and keep things moving!

          <span>
            They say true growth only comes with change. So why get comfy? It's
            only when we push ourselves outside of our comfort zones that we see
            true magic unfold.The same applies to our work—let's not only push
            ourselves in what we create but also assist our partners in shifting
            their perspectives and exploring new approaches.

        <p>FROM THE FOUNDER</p>

        <p>Hospitality Heart, Digital Mind</p>

        <p>
          Hi, I’m Glenn Philips, the founder of LensCraft Studio. My roots are
          planted in the bustling world of hospitality where I spent countless
          hours ensuring that every interaction feels like a warm welcome. Since
          stepping into the digital realm,my journey has been fulled by a
          fascination with the Internet's boundless possibilities that shape how
          we interact with one another online on a daily basis.
          <br />
          <br />
          The vibrant chaos of hospitality taught me skills beyond managing a
          team in a fast paced, high pressure environment. The importance of
          genuine connections, clear communication and the art of making
          everyone feel at home were instilled from the get-go. These principles
          have been my compass while I navigated through the digital landscape,
          merging my love of social connection with my curiosity for the inner
          workings of the online world.
          <br />
          <br />
          At Signal, we go beyond just creating cool websites; we’re crafting
          digital homes for your business that you'll be proud of, ensuring that
          everyone you want at the party feels welcomed.
